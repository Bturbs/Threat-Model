Meeting Transcript - Product Architecture Review
Date: January 15, 2026
Attendees: Dev Team, Security Team

John (Architect): So let me walk you through the architecture of our new e-commerce platform.

We have a React frontend that users access through their browsers. The frontend communicates with our API Gateway which handles all incoming requests.

The API Gateway forwards requests to our main backend service, which is a Node.js application. This backend connects to a PostgreSQL database where we store all user data, including personal information and credit card details.

Sarah (Security): Wait, you're storing credit card data directly?

John: Yes, for now. We encrypt it at rest using AES-256. The backend also connects to Redis for session management and caching.

Mike (Dev): We also have a third-party payment service integration - we send payment requests to Stripe's API.

Sarah: What about authentication?

John: We use JWT tokens. Users login through the frontend, the backend validates credentials against the database and issues a JWT. The token is stored in localStorage on the client.

Sarah: localStorage for JWTs? That's vulnerable to XSS attacks. We should use httpOnly cookies instead.

John: Good point, let's add that to the backlog.

Mike: The backend also exposes a webhook endpoint for receiving payment confirmations from Stripe. And we have an admin panel that internal staff use to manage orders and view customer data.

Sarah: Is the admin panel on the same domain?

Mike: Yes, it's at /admin on the main application. Admin users have elevated privileges in the database.

John: We're planning to add a message queue - RabbitMQ - for handling order processing asynchronously. Orders will be published to the queue and processed by worker services.

Sarah: What about rate limiting on the APIs?

John: Not implemented yet. We're also considering adding Elasticsearch for product search functionality.

Meeting notes:
- Need to review data encryption approach
- Consider PCI compliance requirements  
- Add rate limiting before launch
- Review admin access controls
- Implement proper session management
