# Context YAML Template for Threat Model
meta:
  title: "AI-Enabled Cloud-Native Engineering Organisation IT Estate"
  modelId: "TM-AI-CLOUD-ENG-001"
  version: "1.0"

  scope: |
    This threat model covers the end-to-end IT estate of a modern, cloud-native
    engineering organisation. The scope includes company-managed Mac endpoints,
    identity and access management via Azure AD / Entra ID, source code management
    and CI/CD using GitLab, containerisation using Docker, and internal development
    and staging environments hosted in Azure.

    Collaboration platforms including Slack, Microsoft 365 (Teams, SharePoint,
    OneDrive, Exchange), and Atlassian Jira and Confluence are in scope, alongside
    AI systems such as Microsoft Copilot for M365 and internal or third-party AI
    models. Enterprise DLP, Microsoft Defender for Cloud, Defender for Cloud Apps,
    and the physical security of the office environment are also included.

    Out of scope are customer-owned environments, production customer deployments,
    personal devices, and third-party SaaS platforms not federated with Entra ID.

  description: |
    This system represents a modern, AI-enabled software development organisation
    designed to maximise developer autonomy and delivery speed while maintaining
    strong security controls. Engineers develop and containerise applications on
    Mac endpoints using Docker, store and manage code in GitLab, and deploy
    workloads to Azure-based development and staging environments.

    Productivity and collaboration are supported through Slack, Microsoft 365,
    and Atlassian tools, while AI capabilities such as Microsoft Copilot and
    internal assistants enhance knowledge discovery and content creation.
    Security is enforced using identity-centric controls, enterprise DLP, and
    Microsoft Defender services, with physical office security forming part of
    the overall threat landscape.

  assumptions:
    - All users authenticate through Azure AD / Entra ID with multi-factor authentication enabled
    - All corporate endpoints are company-managed Mac devices with security baselines applied
    - GitLab authentication and CI/CD pipelines are integrated with Azure AD
    - Docker images are built locally or via GitLab CI/CD and stored in approved registries
    - Microsoft Copilot and internal AI models only access data permitted by identity and DLP controls
    - DLP policies are enforced across endpoints, cloud applications, and AI interactions
    - Employees work in a hybrid model and may take devices off-site
    - Insider threat scenarios are considered alongside external attackers

  constraints:
    - Security controls must balance risk reduction with developer productivity
    - The organisation operates under GDPR and internal data protection policies
    - The environment is cloud-first with no traditional on-premise infrastructure
    - Security operations resources are limited, requiring prioritisation of high-impact risks
    - AI systems must comply with data residency, privacy, and governance requirements
